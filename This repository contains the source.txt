This repository contains the source code, data, and documentation for the research project titled "Integrated Modeling and Target Classification Based on mmWave SAR and CNN Approach." This study focuses on leveraging millimeter-wave (mmWave) Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar and advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for high-resolution weapon classification.
Key Highlights: Numerical Modeling: Developed a radar simulation using MATLAB to generate 3605 high-resolution SAR images from 1000 collected weapon images, incorporating realistic reflectivity characteristics. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imaging: Reconstructed detailed profiles of various weapon types (e.g., grenades, knives, guns, iron rods, wrenches) using mmWave FMCW radar. Deep Learning Classification: Achieved over 98% accuracy in weapon classification using a custom-built CNN with 10 layers.
Applications: Potential use cases in security screening, surveillance, and advanced radar-based imaging applications.
